['"Chapter 2.AN: Fangz 2 bloodytearz666 (This Raven?) 4 helpin me wif da chapta! BTW preps stop flaming ma story ok! (No thanks. This is too fun!)The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. (Sleet!!) I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. (And you just randomly have a bottle of blood. Seems legit) My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet (forgive me if I\'m wrong', " but I'm not sure a typical goth color is hot pink.) with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. (Only sensible thing this girl does) Instead", ' I put on a black leather (oof', " leather? I'd just wear that MCR shirt the whole day.) dress", ' a pentagram necklace', " combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings 4 piercings? (Ok good. I'm sure the author will remember that.)  in my pierced ears", ' and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.My friend', " Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!

I talk to a lot of boys everyday)""Yeah? So?"" I said', ' blushing.""Do you like Draco?"" she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.""No I so fucking don\'t!"" I shouted. (Then why were you blushing?)""Yeah right!"" she exclaimed. Just then', ' Draco walked up to me.""Hi."" he said.""Hi."" I replied flirtily. (*sigh* this author. She just said she doesn\'t like him. Choose a side.)""Guess what."" he said.""What?"" I asked.""Well', ' Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade."" he told me.""Oh. My. Fucking. God!"" I screamed. I love GC. They are my favorite band', ' besides MCR. (I...I don\'t think MCR is a goth band. Maybe GC but not MCR. MCR is emo.""Well.... do you want to go with me?"" he asked.I gasped.
