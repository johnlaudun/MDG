# About MDG

The files in this repository were developed in support of an independent study in the digital humanities at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Other uses are encouraged, but please do note that the screenplay for _Apocalypse Now_, included here as a useful point of comparison to _Heart of Darkness_, is still under copyright. Its distribution here is exclusively intended for scholarly purposes.
